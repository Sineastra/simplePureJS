- [x] [01. Stopwatch/Timer](stopwatch)
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Stopwatch/timer. Can be started, stopped (pause) and reset. Accepts display function and updates it with the new timer.
- [x] [02. Day Finder](dayFinder)
- Utility function that accepts **(day, month, year)** and returns the weekday this date was on. Works on all dates from 1572 to present. (Gregorian calendar). Cool story, huh? Now you can see which day you were born on and stuff. In case you didn't know. _**Like me**_...
